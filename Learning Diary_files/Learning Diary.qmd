Note that this entry is to explain the error came at the time of loading CSV in R studio and solution to the error.
:::

When I was trying to upload a CSV in R studio , I got error as @Fig-UploadError . No such file or directory.

*Figure 1*: No such file or directory error

![UploadError](images/UploadError.png){#Fig-UploadError}

**Solution**:

It seems that CSV file is places in different path and Path setup in R is different. So checked the path of directory using getwd(). This gave the detail of current path of R, changed this path to new path using setwd(). This resolved issue and CSV got uploaded successfully.

This diary entry is to explain the the issue I was getting while creating a histogram
:::

*Figure 2*: No color in histogram even after giving color in code.

**Solution**

I realized that parameter for color should be written as 'col' not 'color'. After changes, it worked.
